 6.Machine Wise Rejected Qty 
 7.Production Comparison trend 
 8.Manufacture Vs Rejected

C007,C0039,C022,C023,C037,C024,C008,C020,C018,C028 AND solve the issue

3.Woven Department,  in cut and folder sector is having highest rejection, so More attention should be given here,to reduce rejected quantity
